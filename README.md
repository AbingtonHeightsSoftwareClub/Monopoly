# Monopoly
This project is a web based implementation of classic Monopoly. It uses a Flask, Websocket, and Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or Jakarta faces

## Flask
Flask is a website framework written in Python. A website framework is what you use to structure a website. For example, it maps www.your-website-name.com/path-name to a function located at path-name. You can then return an HTML(Website page) or do some complicated code stuff. 

## Websocket
Websocket is how the server (the website) communicates with its users. Usually, only a user can send a request to a server. The user can ask for a webpage, information, tell the server to do something, or more, but the server can't ask the user for anything. With websockets, the server and users can communicate back and forth without reloading the page, and the server can also give a message to all users at once.

## Front end
The front end of the website is how it looks. It can contain buttons, images, text, animations, and more. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Javascript(JS) are the most common front end languages and are built into every web browser. Jakarta Faces is a front end that is written in Java and replaces all of that. Since we have some members who only know Java, it would be good to have a part in Java. But, Jakarta Faces is an uncommon tool, so we may not be able to integrate it with Flask.
